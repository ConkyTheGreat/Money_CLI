# Contributing Guidelines

Any contribution is more than welcome!

## Reporting Issues

A great way to contribute to the project is to raise an issue.

Please make sure to include a detailed description on how you encountered the bug so that it can be reproduced without great efforts. The better a bug can be reproduced, the faster it can be fixed!

## Pull Requests

We'd love to see your pull requests, even if it's just a typo correction!

However, any significant improvement should be associated to an existing issue.

> Note that if you are adding a new feature, or refactoring or changing the behavior of an existing one in any manner, you'll likely want to document the changes.
>
> This can easily be achieved by adding comments on your code or in the PR description.
